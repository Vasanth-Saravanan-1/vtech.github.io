                    Ensure a shared understanding of software among the parties involved. At the initial stages of the
                    project, our business analysts conducted on-site workshops with the customer’s stakeholders and our
                    team to finalize the main concept of software requirements, architecture and design, and ensure
                    everybody was looking in the same direction.
                    Provide the full-fledged change management process. To handle change requests without delays and
                    prevent their affecting existing functionality, each change request was reflected in the format of a
                    business proposal and added to the project roadmap. Such business proposals included goals, an
                    effect on the project, an amount of work, and a time estimation. And after the changes were
                    implemented, stakeholders on the customer’s side performed user acceptance testing to give the final
                    approval.

                Routine automation. The team automated the whole delivery pipeline within the DevOps approach to speed
                up the development and ensure smooth integration of new functionality with the working solution in the
                future.
                Continuous progress tracking. To stay focused and plan day-to-day efforts more efficiently, the team
                used burndown charts that showed how close they were to completing the sprint’s scope of work. And to
                plan reasonable workloads for future iterations, they looked at a team velocity chart reflecting the
                average amount of work finished per iteration. Such charts become more reliable as the project moves
                forward, say, after 5 iterations and further.

            <p class="">
                Running automated code reviews to measure code quality (with such metrics as Cyclomatic Complexity,
                Depth of Inheritance, Class Coupling, and Lines of Code) was a part of the development routine to avoid
                code complexity that brings problems with software maintenance.
